## Tutorials

* [Tutorial 1: Modeling Conditional Distribution](tutorial_discrete_conditioning.html)

    This tutorial introduces the basic features of PSense.

* [Tutorial 2: Gradient Descent](tutorial_continuous.html)

    This tutorial shows how PSense could be used in the real application: the gradient descent algorithm in machine learning.

* [Tutorial 3: Unknown Vending Machine](tutorial_gradient_descent.html)

    This tutorial introduces how to analyze a cognition model that outputs a continuous distribution.

* [Tutorial 4: Sampling Based Sensitivity Analysis](tutorial_sampling.html)

    This tutorial shows how to use PSense's sampling backend to do approximate sensitivity analysis. The approximate analysis runs faster but is not so accurate.
